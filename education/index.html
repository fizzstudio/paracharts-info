    <h2>Access to information should be universal… but it's not!</h2>

    <p>Charts, graphs, and maps reveal deeper insights into data than mere numbers. But too often, chart software does not provide equivalent affordances for people with disabilities.</p>

    <section id="effect">
      <p>Over 70 million Americans identify as having a disability… <br>28.7% of adults in the United States.</p>

      <p>Among American students, over 7.5 million have a disability… <br>over 15% of all public school students.</p>

    <p>The core insights of charts, such as trends, patterns, outliers, intersections, tracking, and more are immediately obvious to sighted users with normal cognitive abilities, but difficult and time-consuming for blind users to discover or for people with some cognitive impairments to interpret.</p>

            <p>People with blindness commonly use a screen reader to listen to and explore the contents of a web page, including alt text for images.</p>

            <p>At worst, and all too common, charts have no accessible equivelent… no data table, no alt text.</p>
        
            <p>At best, commercial chart software offers serial access… a disjointed sequence of numbers. For trends, the most accessible software offers sonification, such as music notes of higher or lower pitch based on the value of the data point.</p>

          <div>
            <p>People with low vision often use magnifier software, zooming out for the big picture and zooming in and panning around for the details. They often also prefer dark mode, to increase color contrast.</p>

            <p>Charts, with strong colored blocks or lines are often easier than a table of fine text for people with low vision. But they can still struggle with some aspects or oversights.</p>
        
            <p>Charts with legends rather than direct labels force them to zoom and pan much more, taxing their memory.</p>

            <p>And many chart software packages don't respect dark mode, making black text impossible to read and hiding axis lines or even data points.</p>

      <h3>Challenges for creators of charts</h3>
      
      <p>The challenges for people with disabilities is matched by the challenges for those who create, publish, or teach with charts. How do you make a chart that's accessible for everyone?</p>

      <ul>    
        <li><strong>Data visualization accessibity is uncharted territory.</strong> Web accessibility standards such as WCAG say little about it. There is some informal guidance, but it's often technical and difficult to execute with the charting software at hand.</li>
  
        <li><strong>Curriculum workflows are complex.</strong> Curriculum designers have to navigate complicated workflows to ensure that graphics are accessible; often the people making the graphics aren' the authors of the content, and the disconnect shows.</li>
  
        <li><strong>LMSes are on the hook, but not equipped to solve local issues.</strong> Learning management systems struggle with providing a user interface that aid or enforce teachers in making accesssible charts.</li>
  
        <li><strong>Alt text is hard.</strong> It's technically easy to provide alt text for a static chart, but most people don't know how to write good alt text for charts. And it's impossible to do for dynamic charts from live data. Generative AI text from LLMs isn't consistent or private enough to use in education.</li>

        <li><strong>Chart software is the problem.</strong> Most chart software is not accessible, does not make accessible charts, and isn't flexible enough to allow authors to provide their own accomodations.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The unfortunate reality is that data visualization accessibility is an intricate, niche skill, demanding expertise in data visualizations, user interface design, cognitive load theory, and specialized accessibility best practices, and it needs a custom solution for each different chart type and for each type of disability.</p>

      <h3>Legal obligations</h3>

      <p>Despite the challenges, the need for equal access to data and information is laid out in the Effective Communication provision of Title III of the ADA. Charts are not exempt from this; in the past, technological limitations in charts may have sufficed as an undue burden claim, but this is shifting as new technologies become available.</p>

      <h2>Lack of graphicacy</h2>

      <p>Compounding all these difficulties in reading and making charts is that it is a self-perpetuating downward spiral. Because many students with disabilities doen't have access to appropriate accessible graphics, they don't get the value, and never learn to use graphics. This in turn decreases the demand for accessible graphics.</p>

      <p>Graphicacy, or the ability to understand and present information in a non-textual way, is an increasingly important skill in our society. The lack of graphicacy in the blind community is well-documented.</p>

      <p>Breaking the poor graphicacy cycle is critical.</p>

      <h2>The solution: ParaCharts</h2>

      <p class="todo">stuff here</p>

      <h3>Born accessible</h3>

      <p class="todo">stuff here</p>

      <p>Meets WCAG AAA, the highest level, and goes well beyond the standards.</p>

      <p>We have all of the conventional accessibility chart features, such as intuitive keyboard support, in-depth serial data exploration, and sonification. We also offer many innovative new features not found elsewhere, like user-centered color control, braille chart display, low vision mode, and more.</p>

      <h3>Automated descriptions</h3>
      
      <p class="todo">stuff here</p>

      <p>For dynamic charts or live data, we produce high-quality automated descriptions with our custom AI. These are not just captions… we automatically annotate the chart at every level, from the whole chart, to each series, to each data point.</p>
      

      <h3>Always accessible</h3>
      
      <p class="todo">stuff here</p>
      
      <p>Some other charting software has good accessibility, but it's not on by default, and the publisher has to turn it on, not the end-user. With ParaCharts, accessibility is always on… you can't turn accessibility off.</p>


      <h3>Easy to use</h3>

      <p class="todo">stuff here</p>

      <p>A novice user can simply wrap an HTML data table in a ParaCharts element, specify what chart type they want, and the table is instantly transformed into an accessible chart.</p>

      <p>It's equally easy for technology professionals to use, with JSON manifest files, a flexible API, and expansive customization.</p>

      <p></p>

      <h3>Privacy-centric, ethically developed</h3>

      <p class="todo">stuff here</p>

      <p>All of the AI pattern analysis is done directly in the browser, with no need for any external service… which also means, no cloud subscriptions or hidden costs.</p>
      
      <p>The AI was all custom developed by the the Fizz Studio team. All of the training data was commissioned specifically for this project, and the trainers with paid above the average rate. There is no IP infringement, and no risk of unforeseen downstream legal impacts on our customers or users.</p>

      <p>No data ever leaves the chart… not the publisher's data, and not the user's data, without the user taking steps to send or save it. Our sofware doesn't use cookies or store any personally identifiable information (PII); It does store user preferences locally in the browser, but that information is not collected, and can be changed or cleared by the user.</p>


      <h3>ParaCharts raises the bar</h3>

      <p>ParaCharts will be the new standard in chart accessibility by which all other chart software will be judged. Future-proof your educational environment now, or catch up as your competitors pass you by.</p>
