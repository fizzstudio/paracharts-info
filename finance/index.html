    <p>Charts, graphs, and maps reveal deeper insights into data than mere numbers. But too often, chart software does not provide equivalent affordances for people with disabilities.</p>

    <section id="effect">
      <p>Over 70 million Americans identify as having a disability… <br>28.7% of adults in the United States.</p>

      <p><strong>Two-thirds</strong> of people with significant vision loss are over the age of 55.</p>

    <p>The core insights of charts, such as trends, patterns, outliers, intersections, tracking, and more are immediately obvious to sighted users with normal cognitive abilities, but difficult and time-consuming for blind users to discover or for people with some cognitive impairments to interpret.</p>

        <details class="disability-type">
          <summary>Best case: serial access only. Worst case: no access at all.</summary>
          <div>
            <p>People with blindness commonly use a screen reader to listen to and explore the contents of a web page, including alt text for images.</p>

            <p>At worst, and all too common, charts have no accessible equivelent… no data table, no alt text.</p>
        
            <p>At best, commercial chart software offers serial access… a disjointed sequence of numbers. For trends, the most accessible software offers sonification, such as music notes of higher or lower pitch based on the value of the data point.</p>

      <section class="disability-type">

        <details class="disability-type">
          <summary>Charts are easier to see than tables, but poor design can make them hard to read.</summary>
          <div>
            <p>People with low vision often use magnifier software, zooming out for the big picture and zooming in and panning around for the details. They often also prefer dark mode, to increase color contrast.</p>

            <p>Charts, with strong colored blocks or lines are often easier than a table of fine text for people with low vision. But they can still struggle with some aspects or oversights.</p>
        
            <p>Charts with legends rather than direct labels force them to zoom and pan much more, taxing their memory.</p>

            <p>And many chart software packages don't respect dark mode, making black text impossible to read and hiding axis lines or even data points.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Cognitive disabilities are widely varied and often difficult to quantify or address. Charts may offer solutions or challenges.</p>
        
            <p>Memory tasks, such as recalling the meaning of a symbol or color, can be tricky.</p>

            <p>Rotated, crowded, or small text can exacerbate dyslexia.</p>

            <p>Understanding the relationship of numerical values can hinder a person with dyscalculia from grasping the gist of a chart.</p>

            <p>People with CVD (color blindness) may not be able to distinguish colors by name, or even see a distinction between multiple colors.</p>

      <h3>Challenges for creators of charts</h3>
      
      <p>The challenges for people with disabilities is matched by the challenges for those who create, publish, or teach charts. How do you make a chart that's accessible for everyone?</p>

      <p>Data visualization accessibility is uncharted territory. WCAG and web standards say little about it. There is some informal guidance, but it's often technical and difficult to execute with the charting software at hand.</p>
